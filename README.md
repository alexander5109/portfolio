# üë®‚Äçüíª Portfolio: Developments and Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a curated list of my personal and academic projects, covering a range of topics from game modding to web development and desktop applications.

## üß† Highlight Project

### üêé StudbookWebScrapper & RaceStimator
A Python-based script developed for collecting and analyzing horse racing data, designed to assist users in making informed betting decisions before a race event. It scrapes online data, processes it into structured reports, and highlights key statistics for each horse.

Project overview:
- Originally developed as a freelance tool for bettors, it automates the collection of race and horse data from dynamic websites using Selenium and Playwright.
- Processes and structures the data with pandas, storing it in a normalized SQLite3 database.
- Generates daily reports with calculated variables and race-by-race recommendations.

Current evolution:
- The project is now being expanded with a stronger focus on data analysis. Refactoring efforts are underway to:
- Incorporate asynchronous scraping using asyncio for better efficiency.
- Extend the number of variables analyzed to improve prediction quality.
- Improve code structure for future experimentation with predictive algorithms.

Academic collaboration:
This project is part of an ongoing academic research initiative in collaboration with a professional statistician. Together, we will present a poster detailing the algorithmic logic behind this tool at the LI Coloquio Argentino de Estad√≠stica, to be held in Tucum√°n later this year.

## üîß Academic Projects

### üè∞ [CursosStore-FrontendJS](https://github.com/alexander5109/CursosStore-FrontendJS)
A simple but functional frontend-only e-commerce prototype built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches public API data to simulate a catalog of courses, allowing the user to view products, add them to a shopping cart, and simulate a purchase flow using LocalStorage. Created as part of the TalentoTech Frontend course.

### üè∞ [ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF](https://github.com/alexander5109/ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF)
A desktop application developed with WPF and .NET 8.0 to manage doctor-patient appointments in a clinical setting. It offers a modern user interface with custom-styled buttons and supports both JSON-based and SQL Server-based data persistence. The app directly maps models to UI logic without MVVM, offering a practical hands-on CRUD system.

### üè∞ [FormacionLaboralXXI-DjangoWebApp](https://github.com/alexander5109/FormacionLaboralXXI-DjangoWebApp)
A Django web application inspired by real-world training institutions. It provides a user login system and full CRUD capabilities for managing students, courses, and training centers. The frontend is styled using a Bootstrap HTML/CSS template for a clean and responsive experience.

## üîß Gaming & Modding
