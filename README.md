## 🔧 Academic Projects

Created as part of the TalentoTech Frontend course.

### 🏰 [ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF](https://github.com/alexander5109/ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF)
A desktop application developed with WPF and .NET 8.0 to manage doctor-patient appointments in a clinical setting. It offers a modern user interface with custom-styled buttons and supports both JSON-based and SQL Server-based data persistence. The app directly maps models to UI logic without MVVM, offering a practical hands-on CRUD system.
