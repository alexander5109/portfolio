# üë®‚Äçüíª Portfolio: Developments and Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find a curated list of my personal and academic projects, covering a range of topics from game modding to web development and desktop applications.

## üß† Highlight Project

### üêé StudbookWebScrapper & RaceStimator
A Python-based script developed for collecting and analyzing horse racing data, designed to assist users in making informed betting decisions before a race event. It scrapes online data, processes it into structured reports, and highlights key statistics for each horse.

Project overview:
- Originally developed as a freelance tool for bettors, it automates the collection of race and horse data from dynamic websites using Selenium and Playwright.
- Processes and structures the data with pandas, storing it in a normalized SQLite3 database.
- Generates daily reports with calculated variables and race-by-race recommendations.

Current evolution:
- The project is now being expanded with a stronger focus on data analysis. Refactoring efforts are underway to:
- Incorporate asynchronous scraping using asyncio for better efficiency.
- Extend the number of variables analyzed to improve prediction quality.
- Improve code structure for future experimentation with predictive algorithms.

Academic collaboration:
This project is part of an ongoing academic research initiative in collaboration with a professional statistician. Together, we will present a poster detailing the algorithmic logic behind this tool at the LI Coloquio Argentino de Estad√≠stica, to be held in Tucum√°n later this year.

## üîß Academic Projects

### üè∞ [CursosStore-FrontendJS](https://github.com/alexander5109/CursosStore-FrontendJS)
A simple but functional frontend-only e-commerce prototype built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches public API data to simulate a catalog of courses, allowing the user to view products, add them to a shopping cart, and simulate a purchase flow using LocalStorage. Created as part of the TalentoTech Frontend course i took in 2024.

### üè∞ [ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF](https://github.com/alexander5109/ClinicaMedicaGestorDeTurnos-WPF)
A desktop application developed with WPF and .NET 8.0 to manage doctor-patient appointments in a clinical setting. It offers a modern user interface with custom-styled buttons and supports both JSON-based and SQL Server-based data persistence. The app directly maps models to UI logic without MVVM, offering a practical hands-on CRUD system.

### üè∞ [FormacionLaboralXXI-DjangoWebApp](https://github.com/alexander5109/FormacionLaboralXXI-DjangoWebApp)
A Django-based web application inspired by the structure of real-world vocational training systems. It simulates the management of students, institutions, courses, and administrative regions using a normalized relational model.
This project was developed in **2023** as part of the *Programmer course* at **Centro de Formaci√≥n Profesional N.¬∫ 406 (Mor√≥n, Argentina)**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a **demonstration project**, not intended for production use. All authenticated users can create and edit records‚Äîincluding students, institutions, and courses‚Äîto showcase Django‚Äôs ORM, view architecture, and admin integration. Deletion is intentionally restricted to avoid data loss during testing.

**Core features:**
- Custom data models for `Estudiante`, `Curso`, `Institucion`, `Provincia`, and `FamiliaProfesional`, with both hierarchical and many-to-many relationships.
- Login system and Django admin dashboard.
- Slug generation, automatic metadata (created/updated), and flexible course enrollment.
- User avatars support.
- Forms for contact/feedback, modeled as a (`Queja`) in the database.
- SQLite3 backend with a Bootstrap-styled frontend for CRUD operation demonstration.

### üéÆ [BFME2-BosPrimigeniusTaurusTheTW](https://github.com/alexander5109/BFME2-BosPrimigeniusTaurusTheTW)
A Tower War style of map that basicaly reworked the entire gameplay of BFME2 in just a portable map. With this projects i learned BFME2 modding and most important, programing logic, when i designed the scripts of this map adventure.

## üîß Personal Programing Projects
- **Gestor de Tecnicaturas (WIP)** ‚Äî A desktop application designed to help digitize and manage student academic records, created for practical use by school staff. Written in C# with support for JSON, CSV, and SQLite3, it includes utilities to parse Google Sheets exports for bulk data import.
